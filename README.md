#  Mutual Fund End-to-End Analysis Project
📌 Overview

This project was developed as a complete pipeline for analyzing sectoral and stock-level performance in the Indian markets.
It combines data extraction, transformation, exploratory analysis, and visualization to identify strong sectors and validate long-term investment hypotheses.

The notebook demonstrates how raw price and ticker data were processed into actionable insights using Python’s data analysis ecosystem.

## 🎯 Objectives

Load, clean, and consolidate stock/sectoral price data.

Map tickers to their respective industries and company names.

Compute periodic returns across multiple lookback windows (3M, 6M, 1Y, 3Y).

Identify high-performing sectors with sustainable long-term growth.

Visualize sector and stock trends using interactive Plotly charts.

Validate the hypothesis that sectoral performance is a strong predictor of mutual fund success.
